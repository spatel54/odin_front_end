  <!-- JPG = handles larger file sizes without increasing file size. Great for photos 
  with lots of gradients in them. No transparency/

  GIF = animations, limited color pallete, semi-opaque pixels, hard to achieve high level of 
  detail on transparent backgrounds

  PNG = good for anything photo or animated, bigger in file size compared to jpg. 
  Handles opacity just fine and no color pallete limitations. Good for icons,
  technical diagrams, logos, etc.-->
